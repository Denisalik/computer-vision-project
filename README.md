# YOLO based application for object detection
##### We will have a implementaiton of YOLO model and deployment of this model.
Why is it important to control the population of
animals? High number of animals in some area may
lead to habitat abuse, starvation, and death. That is
one of the reasons for ecologists to control population size. Ecologists control density of species
population with use of camera traps. Camera trap
takes a sequence of pictures after it is triggered by
motion nearby. One way Ecologists may evaluate
the number of animals is to analyze this sequence
manually. Alternatively, they may apply an algorithm which will analyze images and predict the
number of animals in given images. Thus, the goal
of this project is to evaluate the number of animals
in a sequence of images taken from Camera Traps.
